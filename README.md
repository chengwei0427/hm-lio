HM-LIO: A Hash Map based LiDAR-Inertial Odometry.

**hm-lio**  is a hash-map based LiDAR-inertial odometry, and this is just my personal experimental demonstration. It manage the local map with hash-map as [**ct-icp**](https://github.com/jedeschaud/ct_icp), and the lio is a simple reproduction of [**FAST-LIO 1.0**](https://github.com/hku-mars/FAST_LIO).

**NOTE:** This is just my personal experimental demonstration, maybe some bugs, feel free to contact me.

## 1. Prerequisites

### 1.1 **Ubuntu** and **ROS**
**Ubuntu >= 18.04**

For **Ubuntu 18.04 or higher**, the **default** PCL and Eigen is enough for ct_lio to work normally.

ROS    >= Melodic. [ROS Installation](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation)

### 1.2. **PCL && Eigen**
PCL    >= 1.8,   Follow [PCL Installation](http://www.pointclouds.org/downloads/linux.html).

Eigen  >= 3.3.4, Follow [Eigen Installation](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page).


## 2. Build

Clone the repository and catkin_make:

**NOTE**:**[This is import]** before catkin_make, make sure your dependency is right(you can change in ./cmake/packages.cmake)

```
    cd ~/$A_ROS_DIR$/src
    git clone https://github.com/chengwei0427/hm-lio.git
    cd ct_lio
    cd ../..
    catkin_make
    source devel/setup.bash
```

- If you want to use a custom build of PCL, add the following line to ~/.bashrc
```export PCL_ROOT={CUSTOM_PCL_PATH}```
  
## 3. Directly run

**Noted:**

**A**. Please make sure the IMU and LiDAR are **Synchronized**, that's important.

**B**. The warning message "Failed to find match for field 'time'." means the timestamps of each LiDAR points are missed in the rosbag file. That is important for the forward propagation and backwark propagation.

**C**. Before run with **NCLT** dataset, you should change time-scale in **cloud_convert.cpp**( static double tm_scale = 1e6)


## 4. Rosbag Example

Run:
```
roslaunch hm_lio run_eskf.launch
cd YOUR_BAG_DOWNLOADED_PATH
rosbag play *
```

### 4.2 Time analysis

There is a time log file in **./log/** after run the code. we can plot the time with the scripts.
```
cd CT-LIO
python3 ./scripts/all_time.py
```
